### Who we are

The RSE group at UKCEH was founded in 2024 by Professor Gordon Blair and Dr Faiza Samreen, who recruited six RSEs with diverse backgrounds in research and industry.

Each [member](/people/index.qmd) of the group brings a unique blend of skills and interests, underpinned by _both_ research _and_ software engineering expertise.

As of the 2025 restructure, the RSE team forms part of the Digital Innovation group within the broader National Capability and Digital Research (NCDR) science area.

### What we do

We work on a wide range of research [projects](/projects/index.qmd) across all five science areas.[^1]
Typically our involvement with a project spans a significant fraction of the project's lifecycle --- i.e. months or years --- and we are frequently involved in the planning and bid-writing stage of a project.

[^1]: Since 2025, UKCEH has five science areas:

    - Biodiversity and Land Use
    - Environmental Pressures and Responses
    - Land-Atmosphere Interactions
    - National Capability & Digital Research
    - Water and Climate Science


We also engage in various activities aligned to the four 'pillars' of research software engineering.[^2]

**{{< iconify mdi:pillar >}} Software Development** \
We work closely with our colleagues in the Digital Engineering and Digital Assets groups, contributing to the development and maintenance of UKCEH's data and digital research infrastructure. [Read more](/updates/#category=software).

<!-- Contributions to open source software? -->

{{< iconify mdi:pillar >}} Community
: We are active in the wider RSE community, contributing to events and special interest groups. We maintain a [community discussion forum](https://github.com/ukceh-rse/community/discussions) for research software at UKCEH. [Read more](/updates/#category=community).

{{< iconify mdi:pillar >}} Training
: We develop open-source [training materials](/tutorials/index.qmd), run [workshops](/workshops.qmd), and offer drop-in 'code clinics' for our colleagues. [Read more](/updates/#category=training).

{{< iconify mdi:pillar >}} Policy
: We promote the 'FAIR' principles[^3] for research software. We advocate recognition of software as a research output and argue for proper resourcing for its maintenance. [Read more](/updates/#category=policy).

[^3]: **FAIR** stands for

    - **F**indable
    - **A**ccessible
    - **I**nteroperable
    - **R**eusable

    The FAIR principles for _research software_ (FAIR4RS) develop this taxonomy.
