  abstract = {Biodiversity loss directly impacts all aspects of life on Earth, so it is vital to understand how climate, pollution, human activities and other factors affect biodiversity. By studying the forces shaping biodiversity, researchers are building a basis for the management of natural resources and putting Europe on the path to recovery. The EU-funded BioDT project will bring together a team of experts in biodiversity, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence to investigate how species interact with their environment and with each other. It will also accurately model interaction between species and their environment. The findings will be used by scientists at research infrastructures to observe changes in biodiversity and relate these changes to possible causes.},
