  abstract = {Biodiversity loss directly impacts all aspects of life on Earth, so it is vital to understand how climate, pollution, human activities and other factors affect biodiversity. By studying the forces shaping biodiversity, researchers are building a basis for the management of natural resources and putting Europe on the path to recovery. The EU-funded BioDT project will bring together a team of experts in biodiversity, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence to investigate how species interact with their environment and with each other. It will also accurately model interaction between species and their environment. The findings will be used by scientists at research infrastructures to observe changes in biodiversity and relate these changes to possible causes.},

  abstract     = {There is often pressure on protected area managers to enhance wild landscapes and protect biodiversity while simultaneously promoting goals such as assuring ongoing provision of ecosystem services and providing for tourist and recreational needs. In the current study, we investigate two tools that may provide different types of management-relevant knowledge on recreation ecosystem services to aid management decisions in a protected area (PA), particularly where such tradeoffs must be considered. We constructed a spatial recreational model of the whole Cairngorms National Park, Scotland (ESTIMAP-Recreation), parameterised by hard and soft recreationalists (providing “where and what” types of knowledge). We then conducted 33 interviews with managers, residents, and visitors, asking if and how they considered the resulting maps useful. In parallel, we conducted focused walking interviews in two contrasting park sites, favoured by hard and soft recreationalist to determine if it was possible to gain further insight into other aspects of the recreational ecosystem services (the “why”). These walking interviews were conducted in a woodland adjacent to an urban area (30 interviews) and in a wild landscape mountain area (22 interviews). The complimentary nature of these approaches highlights the diverse sources of knowledge PA managers may exploit to assist in managing the many conflicting objectives imposed upon them.},

Here, we outline our blueprint for a prototype digital twin (pDT) for cultural ecosystem services. The pDT consists of two modelling components; a recreation potential model to quantify the cultural ecosystem services of the physical landscape and species distribution models to quantify the biodiversity component.

It is envisaged that the digital twin will be used primarily by two user types: 1. those who wanted to enjoy the area and potentially contribute to citizen science programmes and 2. people who want to inform or make evidence-based management decisions (land managers, policy-makers, researchers).},
