This is a brief overview of some of the work going on in this area.\n\nUKRI training\nUKRI’s Associate Director of Environmental Sustainability, Martin Farley, gave a talk about plans for a UKRI training hub. The website for this project is not yet live, but I’m told it will be called SPARKHub: Sustainable Practice and Research Knowledge Hub, and is expected to include\n\nMechanisms to facilitate sustainable research\nTraining resources (or signposting to external resources)\nA certification scheme, most likely based on Green DiSC\nTools for assessment of experiment design\nEmission calculators (or signposting to external calculators)\n\nNetDRIVE are expected to contribute to the training materials, but they are looking for contributions from across the research community.\nIn particular, Martin has funding set aside for a short-form video about sustainable research computing; the most urgent task for the ‘training materials’ working group is to produce a storyboard of content.\nIf you are interested in being involved, get in touch with NetDRIVE (netdriveoxford@gmail.com).\n\n\nNetDRIVE summer schools\nNetDRIVE are running two ‘summer’ schools for PhD students, in Durham (2026) and Edinburgh (2027), and they are looking for input with the curriculum.\nThe content is currently hosted here.\nI feel like there is an opportunity to integrate these outputs into the training programme for the ExaGeo DLA – action Joe.\n\n\nEPCC best practice ‘living document’\nLorna Smith (EPCC, Edinburgh) is involved with the development of a living document containing best-practice guides for sustainable research computing.\nThey have identified three topics to start with:\n\nEfficiency and sustainable use of DRI for simulation\nBalancing research innovation and environmental sustainability\nSustainable operation of DRI hardware\n\nThe first guide is of particular interest to the UKCEH/LU Sustainable DRI project, where we are looking at potential environmental sustainability trade-offs involving machine learning techniques applied to numerical modelling. Lorna also outlined some sub-topics of interest, which included: data management; reusability; failure reduction; use of AI.\n\n\n‘Bite-sized’ training\nKirsty Pringle (SSI, Edinburgh) is working on ‘bite-sized’ training materials that are designed to fit into one-hour long sessions, and include a practical element. I think this is a great idea; it’s clearly targetted at working people who sometimes find themselves with an hour to spare, and the format lends itself to learning as a group (see e.g. CodeRefinery).\n\n\nRelatable case studies\nAnother nice idea is to weave in real, relatable case studies drawn from the researcher community. This is part of what Andy Turner (EPCC, Edinburgh) is working on.\n\n\nReflections on training\nIf there is one thing to criticise about the state of the field right now — and something on show at this workshop — it is the relative scarcity of concrete actions and outputs.\nIt feels like we recognise this, and almost out of desperation to do something, to manifest our ideas somehow, we decide to devote our energy to running workshops or developing new training materials. This is pretty understandable; running workshops or producing training are discrete, completable tasks that, if push comes to shove, can be accomplished by a single individual using their own free time.\nI love teaching and fully believe that education can be transformative, but even I am finding this theory of change difficult to buy into. A proliferation of ad hoc training resources is not a bad outcome per se, but we really need a more coordinated approach that shares the burden of developing and maintaining these resources and integrates them into existing structures and processes.\nOne of the great things about this workshop was how much enthusiasm there was for working across organisations and communities who may not have necessarily talked much in the past."

Paraphrasing: Our current role is to create useful and accessible tools — training resources, metrics, calculators, certifications etc. — in order to chip away at the excuses for not doing green computing on practical grounds. This creates the conditions where funders like UKRI can start including conditions on funding, which in turn leads to monitoring at the national scale.\n\n\n\nThe river Wear, which runs through Durham."

    "section": "Highlights",
    "text": "Highlights\n\n#1 - Differentiable programming\nThe talk that I was looking forward to most was one on differentiable programming, jointly delivered by two very impressive scientist/RSEs and Julia advocates, who also happen to be the brains behind the AD library Enzyme3 (Moses & Churavy, 2020) and the modular atmospheric circulation model SpeedyWeather (Klöwer et al., 2024). The AD/Enzyme part of this talk is published online here.\nA wide range of problems can be attacked by optimising a differentiable scalar ‘loss’ function using variations of gradient descent. For modellers, I’m talking about things like sensitivity analysis, parameter calibration and data assimilation, but of course the most well-known example is gradient-based machine learning.\nNot all models are differentiable, even in principle. Many traditional models contain abrupt transitions between different regimes, often generated by control flow (e.g. if-else) statements, at which point the derivative is undefined.4 Others contain embedded stochastic components which might rely on non-differentiable algorithms such as rejection sampling.\nStill, the main barrier is just the software engineering. Some of these models have been slowly built up over decades and are both enormous and enormously complex. It might be feasible to rewrite individual components to make them differentiable, but in many cases components are so deeply intertwined that doing so would trigger a cascade of complex changes throughout the rest of the model.\n\nWhich language for differentiable programming?\nIn a breakout group on the same topic there was a roughly equal three-way split between Julia users, Jax users, and a ‘manual differentiation’ group implementing adjoints and tangents manually in Fortran.\nI’m spiritually in the Julia camp, but for a few reasons will probably stick with Jax for now. The main reason is that I’m far more research than I am software engineer, and too limited in both skill and time to dig myself out of holes caused by undocumented upstream bugs. The other main reason is that most of my colleagues at UKCEH use R, so it’s already asking a lot to persuade them to work with Python, and Julia might be a step too far. In the longer term I think Julia could become my go-to language for modelling problems, if not data problems, and I’m especially looking forward to exploring the CliMA ecosystem.\n\n\n\n#2 - Data-driven discovery of a reduced complexity model for cloud cover\nI liked this talk a lot because it combined the high-level picture with some solid practical advice gained by actually building the thing. The section I want to highlight here is about using machine learning to improve the cloud-cover component of the ICON climate model.\nInitially they went down the classic route of training a vanilla feedforward neural network on some (cloud‑cover) data and transplanting the trained network into the model. It worked ok — and at this point many people would simply say job done, or optimise some hyper-parameters — but they wanted something faster and more interpretable.\nThey replaced the neural network with an analytical ansatz, and used the same cloud cover data to determine the most important terms and their coefficients by symbolic regression. Notably, the procedure revealed an important term that is typically missing from standard parametrisations.\nThis resulted in a model with just a handful of coefficients multiplying terms that have unambiguous physical interpretations, which nevertheless performed on par with the neural network while being much faster to compute. To top things off, they were able to impose physical constraints on the analytical model that would have been much more difficult to achieve with the neural network.\nDetails about this work can be found in Grundner et al. (2023).\n\n\n#3 - GPUs and the future of scientific computing\nI’m paraphrasing a very interesting conversation that I was on the periphery of.\nWe (scientists and publicly funded research organisations) are no longer the primary customers for GPU vendors — as one put it, “we are small fish”. We should not therefore expect the machine learning ecosystem to prioritise our needs. One early warning sign is some new GPU lines de-prioritising or even dropping Float64, which suits data and machine learning workloads but makes them unsuitable for much scientific numerical modelling.\nThese worries will be irrelevant if we cannot afford to buy high-end GPUs in the first place. Given the rapid increase in GPU costs and the potential slowing down of public sector investment, it’s certainly not guaranteed that we will always be able to find the money.\nSo what’s the silver lining?\nWell… GPUs are not a good solution to every computational problem. Porting most existing scientific codes to GPU would probably result in slower execution and massive amounts of wasted time and energy due to under-utilisation of the GPU and expensive data transfer between devices.5\nWe probably need to be much more thoughtful and intentional about which problems demand acceleration that is best served by high-performance GPUs (as opposed to consumer-grade GPUs or other optimisations) and can be reformulated (parallelised), implemented, and scaled6 so as to effectively utilise the hardware."

    "text": "Summary & Reflections\nIt is easy for me to see why the Julia folks decided to peel off and start again from a clean slate, using a modern language that makes it easy to build in differentiability, GPU-optimisation and other nice things from the foundations. This is certainly the direction I intend to persue in my work. That said, I have enormous respect for those who choose to dedicate their time to getting more out of existing models. For me, it is clear that both approaches are important and need to happen in tandem.\nWe should acknowledge that the models we rely on now cannot be smoothly updated, and that innovation will be severely constrained if we pour all of our resources into their maintenance. At the same time, there is a huge amount of valuable knowledge embedded in these communities and in the models themselves, which needs to be conserved even as the next generation of models ramp up.\nFrom my (relatively uninformed) perspective, the biggest challenge is to figure out sustainable funding model supports the graceful continuation of existing models and communities while making space for the ‘disruptors’ who want to move far more quickly — that is, give them a genuine alternative to going to work for Google or Nvidia.\n\nOn a final note\nI’ve never been to Cambridge before and it was really quite lovely — especially the old town and the college who put us up — although to me the whole city gave off distinctly ‘school’ vibes. Walking through well-kept grounds to an ancient dining hall,7 I kept expecting to be called to attention by a gowned professor chastising me for not wearing my clothes properly or sufficiently embodying the spirit of Selwyn College.\n\n\n\nSelwyn College, where workshop attendees stayed."

AD is performed at the intermediate representation level (MLIR), which means it can work with any LLVM-based language including C, C++, Rust, and even modern Fortran!↩︎\nPoint-like discontinuities (i.e. piecewise differentiable functions) are actually perfectly tolerable, although abrupt changes in gradients can lead to numerical instabilities. But many AD frameworks will just refuse to differentiate through control flow logic.↩︎\nGenerally speaking, small problems (including small ML problems) are faster on CPU unless you can move the entire problem to the GPU (like Oceananigans).↩︎\nThe types of problems that can continue to benefit from increasing GPU parallelism and on-device memory are those problems with good weak scaling. That is, problems where it makes sense to scale the number of independent computations with the hardware (e.g. increasing the batch size in ML). Not all scientific modelling problems tick this box!↩︎\nWalls lined with portraits of old white dudes staring down at you while you eat - check.↩︎"

As of 20/08/2025 this is still in pre-release, but it can be downloaded here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis will only work for projects, i.e. when there is a _quarto.yml file containing the project field.\nHowever, there is no real downside to upgrading stand-alone documents to projects. Simply create a _quarto.yml file with the following contents:\nproject:\n  type: default\n\n\n\n2.1 Existing projects\nFirst, install the extension.\n\nCommand lineRStudio\n\n\nRun the following command in the root directory of your quarto project.\nquarto add ukceh-rse/brand-yml\n\n\nTo do.\n\n\n\nThis will install the extension under the _extensions subdirectory. If you’re using version control, you will want to check in this directory.\nYou will need to specify the desired format when you render.\n\nCommand lineRStudio\n\n\nquarto render --to FORMAT\n\n\nTo do\n\n\n\nIf you plan to render to multiple formats with the same file extension you will also need to specify an output file (--output FILE) so that they don’t overwrite each other.\n\n\n2.2 New projects\nThe extension also serves as a starter template for stand-alone Quarto documents and presentations. There are currently 5 formats provided out of the box.\n\nhtml\ntypst\ntypst-dark\nrevealjs\nrevealjs-dark\n\n\nCommand lineRStudio\n\n\nTo create a new project based on this template, run the following:\nquarto use template ukceh-rse/brand-yml\n\n\nTo do.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Without installing an extension\nAn alternative is to simply download the contents of _extensions/brand/ and manually place them in your quarto project.\nRename brand.yml -&gt; _brand.yml so that it is picked up automatically. This will also work for non-projects (no _quarto.yml)."

    "section": "3 FAQ",
    "text": "3 FAQ\n\n3.1 Why not use the existing templates?\nWe have a couple of very nice templates for UKCEH-branded powerpoint presentations and word documents.\nHowever, people increasingly prefer to work with plain text documents, which are superior to Microsoft’s formats in a number of ways:\n\nPortability: can be read and edited on any device without requiring proprietary or closed-source software\nLongevity: you will be able to open, read and edit plain text files in 20 years time. Can you say the same for a Word document?\nCompatibility with version control software.\nSupports multiple output formats from a single plain text source.\nSupports blending of executable code and regular text.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, a significant number of people with UKCEH already use Quarto, RMarkdown (its predeccessor) and Shiny already. There are already numerous official UKCEH outputs — mostly dashboards and Shiny apps — that were produced with these tools, but with the branding applied loosely or not at all.\n\n\n3.2 How is this consistent with the UKCEH branding?\nThe logos, colours, fonts and typographic information used in brand-yml were lifted from the UKCEH Brand Book (v4.0, September 2024).\nThe brand book does not provide guidance on dark-themed documents, so I applied a little creative freedom here in deciding which colours to use as primary, secondary, background etc.\n\n\n3.3 Has this been approved by Comms?\nShort answer — no.\nLonger answer — not yet. I am in contact with folk in the design team and they are on the whole positive about the whole thing. However, they have wisely suggested waiting until the ongoing rebrand has sorted itself out before pushing ahead with efforts to make this ‘official’.\n\n\n3.4 Where is the UKCEH brand-yml kept?\nOn GitHub, at github.com/ukceh-rse/brand-yml.\nThe repository is currently housed under the RSE’s own GitHub organisation (github.com/ukceh-rse). Once (if) this gets approved by the Comms team for organisation-wide use, we may find that it needs to be moved to the official UKCEH GitHub organisation (github.com/NERC-CEH).\n\n\n3.5 What about templates that reproduce the official Word and Powerpoint templates?\nThis has been on my radar for a while, and I made a start with a Quarto/RevealJS presentation template that closely aligns with the official Powerpoint template.\nHowever, it involves a fair amount of Javascript to get working, and I’m not overly satisfied with my initial attempt.\nI plan to revisit this once the rebranding is complete, which will likely result in the official document templates changing anyway.\n\n\n3.6 I’ve found a bug, what do I do?\nPlease raise an issue on GitHub if you are able to. Otherwise get in touch with Joe directly."
